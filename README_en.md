## Tips
If you found that some text isn't your language, just modify [the config file](#configuration) to your language.

## Supported versions (but it does not mean that it cannot run on other versions):

- Spigot/Paper/Folia 1.17~latest

# If you want to know how to use it, please add help after each command, for example /toneko help
# Commands for the owner (permission is command.toneko.xxx)

### Main configuration file: `config.yml`
#### Path:

I won't go into details about how to edit it, there are comments.

That's all.
